        in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics as well 
        as aeronautical engineering. In 2002, APJ Abdul Kalam was 
        chosen as India’s 11th President, Having backing from both
         the ruling Bharatiya Janata as well as the opposing

        Kalam was extremely earnest and diligent in his studies, 
        but his teachers recognised him as having a tremendous 
        desire to study. He finished his secondary studies at 
        Ramanathapuram’s Schwartz Secondary School. In 1955, 
        he graduated from Saint Joseph’s College at Tiruchirappalli 
        with a diploma in physics. He subsequently went to Madras 
        to further his education, graduating from the Engineering 
        And Technology Institute with a diploma in aircraft engineering. 
        His dream of becoming a military pilot was crushed when the IAF 
        only had eight slots available, and he finished ninth. 
        Following graduation, he worked as a scientist for the 
        “Defense Research Service” and the “Aeronautical Development 
        Establishment.”
